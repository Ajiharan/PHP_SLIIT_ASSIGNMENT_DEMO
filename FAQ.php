         <summary>What warranties do you offer?</summary>
         <p class="text">Owners of iPhone, iPad or Mac products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers, including Apple Retail Stores and Independent Repair Providers, for a minimum of 5 years from when Apple last distributed the product for sale.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>What is your return/exchange policy?</summary>
         <p class="text">Standard Return Policy
          There are a few important things to keep in mind when returning a product you purchased online from Apple:
          
          You have 14 calendar days to return an item from the date you received it.
          Only items that have been purchased directly from Apple, either online or at an Apple Retail Store, can be returned to Apple. Apple products purchased through other retailers must be returned in accordance with their respective returns and refunds policy.
          Please ensure that the item you're returning is repackaged with all the cords, adapters and documentation that were included when you received it.
          There are some items, however, that are ineligible for return, including:
          
          Opened software*
          Electronic Software Downloads
          Software Up-to-Date Program Products (software upgrades)
          Apple Gift Cards (includes previous generation Apple Store Gift Cards and App Store & iTunes Gift Cards)
          Apple Developer products (membership, technical support incidents, WWDC tickets)
          Apple Print Products
          *You can return software, provided that it has not been installed on any computer. Software that contains a printed software license may not be returned if the seal or sticker on the software media packaging is broken.
          
          </p>
      </details>
      <details>
         <summary>Do I have to include accessories like chargers and cables?</summary>
         <p class="text">In some cases, your final trade-in value can vary depending on if you send in your power adapter or not. You don’t have to, but you can always send in your chargers and cables, and we will recycle them for you.</p>
      </details>
	   
	   <details>
         <summary>What can I do with my old Apple Products?</summary>
         <p class="text">Every Apple Certified Refurbished product completes a rigorous refurbishment process that includes full testing that meets the same functional standards as new Apple products. Your refurbished device is truly “like new,” with special savings of up to 15%.</p>
      </details>
	   <details>
         <summary>Is my personal data safe?</summary>
         <p class="text">Before you send us your device, we’ll tell you how to back up and erase all of your data. This will ensure that all of your personal information is completely removed from your device before you trade it in or recycle it.</p>
