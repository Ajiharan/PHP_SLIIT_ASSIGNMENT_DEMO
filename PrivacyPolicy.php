				<h3>Safari throws trackers off your trail</h3>

			<td>
				<p>Some websites allow hundreds of different data collection companies to watch you, build a profile of you, and serve you ads as you browse the web. Intelligent Tracking Prevention in Safari uses on-device machine learning to help block those trackers. And you can get a snapshot of all the cross-site trackers Safari is blocking by visiting your Privacy Report in the Safari toolbar.<br><br>
					Advertisers can also create a “fingerprint” of your device to target you based on characteristics like your browser configuration, and fonts and plug-ins you’ve installed. To help prevent this, Safari has built-in fingerprinting defense, which shares a simplified system profile with websites you visit. Making it even more difficult for data companies to identify you.</p>

				<p>Easy-to-read privacy labels on the App Store help you choose apps based on how they use your data and whether they track you.</p>
				<p>Every one of the more than 1.8 million apps on the App Store is required to follow strict privacy guidelines and report how it uses your data. And every app is rigorously reviewed by a team of experts at Apple.</p>
				<p>When you’re checking out an app, you’ll see its privacy label to help you decide if it works for you. Apps you choose to download need your permission to access information like your photos or location — and you can always change your mind about what you share. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 or later require developers to get your permission before tracking your activity across other companies’ apps and websites for ads or data brokers.</p>

					For the safety of our customers and colleagues, all orders are currently shipping with free, no-contact delivery.

					In most metro areas, we also offer same-day courier delivery for in-stock items when you order online. The two-hour delivery fee is $9. And in some areas, you can also schedule a delivery time window.
					<br><br>
					Pickup
					<br><br>
					Depending on your location, your order may be eligible for In-Store, Curbside, or Express Pickup.
					<br><br>
					In-Store Pickup: Pick up your online order at the Apple Store. Temperature checks and face masks may be required.
					<br><br>
					Express Pickup: Pick up your online order at an Express Pickup location at or near the Apple Store. You can pick up your items and be on your way. Available in select locations.
					<br><br>
					Curbside Pickup: Pick up your online order without leaving your vehicle. Just park in a designated spot and let us know you’ve arrived, and we’ll bring your order right out. Available in select locations.</p>

				<h3>What Is Personal Data at Apple?</h3>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<p> At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is considered non-personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
					<br><br>
					This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them. </p>
